This project was compiled in java 1.8.0_45, so you need to set your java version to that if it isn't set to it already.

The files are in a package called blackjack. So to run the files, you would use the command "java blackjack.<class_name>"

BlackjackGame is the main game file, but the other files also have main methods that contain unit testing for each class

The other classes with unit testing included are as follows:
Card
Deck
Player
